NanodeControl
=============

Web based application for controlling Nanode and Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. Written 
by Leon Wright, 2013, techman83@gmail.com

This web app is designed to be flexible and controllable from any device, from a 
PC to a Smartphone. The intention is for it to also be hosted by a Raspberry pi.

It partners with the Nanode devices:

and Nanode Remote:

I've not written any web apps before, so this was quite a learning experience!

Installation instructions need further fleshing out along with this readme. However 
several people have asked me to get it up on github, so here it is :)
